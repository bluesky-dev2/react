# How to Contribute

We want contributing to the ReactJS Dallas website to be a great experience for anyone who wants to help. Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits; we are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including the following:

- Submitting updates to documentation that helps others build and contribute
- Submitting spelling or grammar fixes
- Adding test coverage
- Reporting bugs or issues
- Teaching others how to contribute to our project!

## Not sure how to start contributing?

You can reach out to [Mike Mathew (@drumsensei) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drumsensei) or submit an issue so someone on the team can give guidance.

## The usual contributing steps are:

- Fork the official repository.
- Clone your fork: `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<your-username>/reactjs-dallas-site.git`
- Setup up repo and install dependencies: `yarn`
- Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name`
- Run the project in dev mode: `gatsby develop`
- Add tests and code for your changes.
- Once you're done, make sure all tests still pass: `yarn test`. (Once we have tests set up!)
- Commit and push to your fork.
- Create a pull request from your branch.
